## Museum of Illusions Kansas City

The visit was fun and all the exibits were amazing but if had to pick The Infinty room and Bottom less pit. **Infinity Room** : Have you any idea where fun and wonder never
end? In the infinity room, the room of mirrors. Mirrors at full height are installed all around creating an optical illusion of infinite space. **The Bottomless Pit** : There are so many things in life that we tend< to compare with a bottomless pit even though we have never seen it. Well, itâ€™s time to see it.
